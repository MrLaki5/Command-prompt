	Help expr:
		Expression in select:

		   2. OR(arg1,arg2)
		   3. XOR(arg1,arg2)
		   4. NOT(arg)
		   5. name="arg_string"
		   6. size="arg_int"
		   6. size="arg1_int-arg1_int"
		   7. time="DD.MM.YYYY."
		   8. time="DD.MM.YYYY.-HH:MM:SS"
		   9. time="spec_arg" #spec_arg is made from one number and one char (H-hour, D-day, M-Month, Y-year)
		Expression in compare:
	       	   1. AND(arg1,arg2)
		   2. OR(arg1,arg2)
		   3. XOR(arg1,arg2)
		   4. NOT(arg)
		   5. name="arg_string,name_of_select"
		   6. size="arg_int,name_of_select"
		   6. size="arg1_int-arg1_int,name_of_select"
		   7. time="DD.MM.YYYY.,name_of_select"
		   8. time="DD.MM.YYYY.-HH:MM:SS,name_of_select"
		   9. time="spec_arg,name_of_select" #spec_arg is made from one number and one char (H-hour, D-day, M-Month, Y-year)

		All args in AND,OR,XOR,NOT are one of name,size,time expressions.
